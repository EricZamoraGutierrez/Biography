                A soul " Aristotle says", is the actuality of a body that has life, where life means the capacity for
                self-sustenance, growth, and reproduction.
                If one regards a living substance as a composite of matter and form,
                then the soul is the form of a natural—or, as Aristotle sometimes says, organic—body.
